# Advent of Code 2021

The Advent of Code is a series of problems that are released every day until Christmas, like an advent calendar.
Each day consists of two problems, the second one unlocking once the first correct answer has been submitted. The
problems are not intended to be solved with any specific language, therefore it is dealer's choice on the language
used to solve the problems.

I have chosen to use Lua for these challenges as it is a language that I want to get better with. If I end up really
struggling, I may solve one or two problems with TypeScript. I am going to do my hardest to use Lua for them all though.
